- class MainTable:
//How do we get the data for internal comparators? -> Filter by InHierarchy / Current Wave (just need a smart way to implement)
//GetVerticalExpression - Filter Expression should have another function as this is probably the only thing that is not common

           - class MainTable - added Horizontal & vertical expression function
                             - Main table takes data and text from GRID, not individual questions
